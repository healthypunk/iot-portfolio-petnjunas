# Reflection 2 in Module 2

- What is your take-away, what do you want to remember, what would be your advice?
  Take-away can be small summary, but better outstanding points.
  A short summary. Don't be late to class, check the provided hardware for faults, remember to write stuff down during the class. 
- What was good?
  Triggering the solanoid and the relay with a click of a button
- What was difficult, where did you struggle?
  Doing the mini projects was extremely stressful, discouraging and frustrating, as none of the hardware provided did seem/want to work togetheer, so a lot of time was spent on finding failed hardware, replacing it, and then finding out that the other hardware didn't work.
- Was there any good/fun “struggling”/exploration?
  Any show stoppers – anything where you should reach out to peers or instructors?
  The mini projects have turned out to be a very big show stopper and a lot of instructor help was needed.
- How was your interaction with peers/instructors?
  Very good.
- Help and extra work
  - Who helped you, gave feedback, was it valuable?
  - Who did you help, gave feedback to?
  - Did you present, implement, made a PR, or fix something that was crucial for the class in itself?
    Instructors helped me a ton.
